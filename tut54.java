/*
 * Interface:
 * English-It is a point where 2 systems meet or interact
 * Jave-It is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
 * 
 * The advantages of using interfaces in Java are as follows:
 * Without bothering about the implementation part, we can achieve the security of the implementation.
 * In Java, multiple inheritances are not allowed, however, you can use an interface to make use of it as you can implement more than one interface.
